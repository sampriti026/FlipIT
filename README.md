# FlipIT

FlipIt is a decentralised application for digital assets owner to list their assets (mobile apps, SaaS, Shopify Stores...) for auction using escrow-enabled smart auction contract. Consider this as a web3 version of Flippa or MicroAcquire. Initially the product aimed at creating a market for automated tokenization of digital assets, however, owing to legal difficulties of due diligince and technical challenge of linking the value of token to the off-chain revenue of digital assets, the product was limited to auctions and connecting buyers and sellers.
